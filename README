===================================

 Tie::Hash::ImmutableKeys - Perl module to create a HASH where keys are immutable but not the leaf data.  It is possible to modify the key by FORCE_STORE or FORCE_DELETE.  It is working on all the tree key created (keys and subkeys are immutable).


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

EXAMPLE

   use Data::Dumper;

         my $z = { aze => 100, tyuiop => 333, qsdfg => 987 };
         my $f = { A   => 0,   Z      => 1,   E     => 0, L => $z };
         my $a = { a   => 0,   z      => 1,   e     => 1, r => 1, AA => $f };

         my $list = {
             S => $a,
             F => $f,
             P => "leaf"
         };

         ## Tie the hash with a list of key and values
         tie( my %a, 'Tie::Hash::ImmutableKeys', $list );

         ## Try to modify a value . If the key is missing this command fail
         my $ar = "z" ;
         if ( defined( $a{ S }->{ $ar } = 1111 ) )
         {
             print "The key is present and data are updated " . Dumper( \%a );

         }else
         {
             print "The key is NOT present and data are NOT updated " . Dumper( \%a );
         }
